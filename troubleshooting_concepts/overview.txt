1. Identify the problem
2. Create a reproduction case
3. Find the root cause

Intermittent issues:

	- Heisenbug issue: an issue that goes away when observers. The observer effect.
	- Find a way to reproduce the issue that doesn't affect users then create tests that trigger 
	  the bug reliably.

Binary searching: divide the possible causes of a problem in half and investigate just one half of the
of the possible causes. Break down the problem into smaller and smaller pieces in order to elimnate 
possible sources of failure more quickly.
