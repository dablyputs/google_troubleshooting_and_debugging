                  <p>There's a ton of different reasons why a computer might crash. This <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-computers-crash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><u>Scientific American article</u></a> discusses many of the possible reasons, including hardware problems and issues with the overall operating system or the applications on top.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>On Linux or MacOS, the worst kind of crash is called a Kernel Panic. On Windows, it's known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><u>Blue Screen of Death</u></a>. These are situations where the computer completely stops responding and only a reboot can make it work again. They don't happen often, but it's good to understand what they mean: the whole OS encountered an error and it can't recover.</p>
                  <p>We called out that reading logs is super important. You should know how to read logs on the operating system that you're using. Here are some resources for this:</p>

                  <p>You also need to be familiar with the tools available in your OS to diagnose problems. These are the tools we called out, but you don't need to limit yourself to them:</p>
